# Boss Fight Atlas

**Interactive pattern library for boss encounter designers.** Each lesson explains how to shape, communicate, tune, and test one part of a boss encounter.

[Explore the atlas](https://polyakovin.github.io/gamedev-boss-fights/) · [Build a boss sketch](https://polyakovin.github.io/gamedev-boss-fights/en/builder/) · [Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)

The atlas indexes all **124 mechanics** from the research audit. Five are complete lessons—**Charge**, **Arc sweep**, **Ground slam**, **Summon**, and **Gap volley**—with interactive diagrams, implementation checklists, design lenses, sources, and boss references. The other 119 have lightweight public pages marked **WIP** while their detailed material is developed. The **Boss builder** can combine any of the 124 mechanics and download the resulting sketch as JSON; its draft stays in your browser.

Available in English, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Hindi, Bengali, Spanish, Arabic, and Japanese. Facts, design concepts, examples, and translations all welcome independent review. [Open the Russian catalog](https://polyakovin.github.io/gamedev-boss-fights/ru/).

## Make your first contribution

A single wording correction, factual check, concept review, or translation improvement is a useful PR. Open a lesson’s **Improve this page** link, edit its JSON on GitHub, and propose the change from your fork. Keep the keys and array order intact. You do not need to add a whole mechanic or translate all eight languages to contribute.

- [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md): small PRs, checks, and review.

- [Translation guide](docs/translation-guide.md): language files, terminology, and review status.
- [Audit of 124 boss mechanics](docs/research/boss-mechanics-audit.md): normalized terms, examples, and sources.

## Run locally

Use **Node.js 24**, as recorded in `.node-version`, and npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:4173/gamedev-boss-fights/](http://localhost:4173/gamedev-boss-fights/). The Russian lesson is at `/gamedev-boss-fights/ru/mechanics/charge/`, and the localized builder is at `/gamedev-boss-fights/ru/builder/`.

The development command builds once and serves `dist/`. After editing source files, run `npm run build` in another terminal and refresh the page. There is no automatic rebuild watcher.

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run check
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

`check` verifies repository hygiene, validates content, runs Node tests, and builds the static site. Browser tests cover the rendered experience; install Chromium once before running them. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what to inspect manually.

Use `npm run format` to apply the pinned Prettier formatting, or `npm run format:check` to check it without rewriting files.

## How it is built

This is a static Node generator with plain HTML, CSS, browser JavaScript modules, and original SVG illustrations. It has no frontend framework or application server in production. GitHub Pages serves the generated files.

Repository documentation, code, tests, and metadata use English. Translated text belongs in `locales/`, `content/mechanics-index-locales/`, and locale-specific lesson and lens JSON. The repository check rejects non-English text outside those locations and exact duplicate files.

The compact public inventory is generated from the audit with `npm run sync:mechanics-index`. Start developing one of its WIP entries into a full lesson with `npm run new:mechanic -- its-existing-id`, or create a lens with `npm run new:lens -- your-lens`. A full mechanic remains WIP until it is complete in all eight languages, each translation’s `sourceVersion` matches `meta.contentVersion`, placeholders are resolved, and an animation is registered. Read the [content guide](docs/content-guide.md) before publishing.

When the mechanics audit changes, run `npm run sync:mechanics-index` to rebuild the public inventory and its localized copy.

The default URL prefix is `/gamedev-boss-fights/`. `lib/config.mjs` defines the repository, site origin, and base path. Forks that publish their own site should update those values for their destination; normal contribution forks do not need deployment credentials.

## Visitor analytics

The GitHub Pages workflow includes Cloudflare Web Analytics for this repository. The public beacon token is used only in the final production build; local builds and forks omit the beacon unless `CLOUDFLARE_WEB_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` is explicitly set. The redirect at `/gamedev-boss-fights/` is excluded so it does not add a second page view before `/en/` loads.
